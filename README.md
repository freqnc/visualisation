Visualisation
=============

A repository of Visualisation mini projects created from 2009 to present.

This repository contains code and links to learnings within Visualisation, InfoVis and Visual communication.

I'm a designer living and working in London, UK.

Inspiration for these projects comes from a number of sources, including software, tools and speakers 
most recently from EyeO 2014 in Minneapolis, MN which I attended for the first time.

Hope this repo helps someone out there.

Thanks,
Fredy
